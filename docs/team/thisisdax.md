### Project: TeamContact 24/7

TeamContact 24/7 - v1.2 is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). It has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to revert to a previous state of the application.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users will be able to undo or redo unwanted commands and revert to a previous state.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands only. Further maintenance and modification is required to change it to affect all upcoming newly added commands.
