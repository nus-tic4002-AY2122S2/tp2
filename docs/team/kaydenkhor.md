# Overview:

MyContentPlanner is a desktop app for managing content posting and scheduling for social media managers, optimized by including UI so that users are able to see both post and client list. 
Users, who are social media manager, will have their content ready for posting on their client's account just because they have planned it in advance with MyContentPlanner.

- Converted user story into implementable functions
- Assigning functions for team mate for implementation
- Assist in function implementation
- Assist in Documentation
- Implemented edit function for both Client and Post list.
- Merging of all pull request so as to ensure all function are integrated smoothly (Includes bugs fixing, code reviews and manual code merging)
- Overall project code refactoring after each merge of PRs.
- J-Unit testing
- Proper branching and code tagging for team repo.

### Bugs fixing for:
-	help function
-	add function
- edit function


## Contributions to the UG:
Wrote the details of the user guide. From time to time, I have been updating the whole userguide.md file whenever I merge the PRs into the master repo. Although team mates have implemented function, but they didn’t update the UG or DG. Hence as I merge into the main repository, I update the UG from time to time. You can look at the amount of documents committed via my code contribution.
I help in maintaining the website for our repo as well as linking up all the relevant documents to our website like developerguide.md, userguide.md, aboutus.md.

## Contribution to DG: 
Drafted out the whole DG sections:
-	Acknowledgement
-	Design & Implementation
-	Product scope (Update every version as our software develops…)
o	Target user profile
o	Value Proposition
-	User Stories (Update every version)
-	Non-functional Requirements
-	Glossary


## Contributions to team-based tasks
-	Assist in team communication
-	Necessary general code enhancements
-	Setting up tools e.g., GitHub, Gradle
-	Maintaining the issue tracker
-	Release management
-	Updating user/developer docs that are not specific to a feature e.g. documenting the target user profile, user story
-	Incorporating more checkstyle plugin.
-	Setting & planning milestones
-	Presented software demos of v1.0 and v2.0 to professors. Shooting the demo video for v3.0.
-	Assigning task to team members as well as setting deadlines to hit milestones for v1.0, 2.0 and 3.0.
-	Bug fixing for team.

## Review/mentoring contributions:
-	Guided team mates to use proper branching for function implementation
-	Assigned team mates with issues and deadline
-	Gave feedbacks and comments on PRs whenever there is an issue with the CI or I see if there’s a better way of code implementation.
