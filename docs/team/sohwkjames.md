### Project: GreatBook

Greatbook is an enhancement of the AddressBook Level 3 application. It is an application for priamry school
teachers to keep track of their student's details. The user interacts with the application with a CLI and a GUI.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

- Enhancement on existing feature: Added "classroom" as an attribute for students, allowing users to specify which classroom a student is in
  - What it does: Allows user to specify what classroom a student is in, and also display it on the UI.
  - Justification: Our target user is primary school teachers who manage students. Since all primary school students have a classroom name, this enhancement allows the app to be used meaningfully be teachers.
  - Highlights: A new Java class was created to handle this enhancement. Existing command parsers were modified to fit this new Class, and many existing tests were refactored to handle this as well. New code was written in a way to fit into existing codebase's design patterns.
  - Credits: I used the design patterns of the existing AddressBook Level 3 codebase to implement this enhancement.
- Enhancement on existing feature:
  - Improved UI by adding label titles on the Person card. Before, values for students classroom and student subject marks would be displayed plainly. With the improvement, the marks and classroom attribute are labelled properly in the UI, allowing for much better user experience.
- Documentation: 
  - Updated user guide to reflect the features added by teammates (Adding a student with subject marks, classroom, and preferred way of receiving updates).
- Review/mentoring contributions: 
  - Assisted teammates by solving bugs with their PR. [Example](https://github.com/AY2122S2-TIC4002-F18-2/tp2/pull/23)
  - Adviced teammates on refactoring existing AB3 tests to fit new code.
- Contributions beyond the project team:
  - Set up team repo, set up versioning, assigned stories to teammates.
