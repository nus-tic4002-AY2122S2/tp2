### Project: TeamContact 24/7 App

TeamContact 24/7 - v1.4 is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) for
the busy software project Manager. It is written in Java, has a GUI created with JavaFX and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to log a brief work-related intercourse update or note on a stakeholder contact.
    * What it does: allows the user to view at a glance the latest intercourse update with contact.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the Project Manager will know the previous intercourse update done with contact.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is log specific on the latest communication message and status with contact.
