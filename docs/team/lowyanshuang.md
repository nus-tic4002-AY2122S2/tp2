### Project: AddressBook Level 3

TeamContact 24/7 is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). It has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add/edit remarks.
  * What it does: allows the user to enter so notes on the contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because there might have some notes that we would like to note down on the contact person.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
