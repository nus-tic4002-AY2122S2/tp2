_**TeamContact 24/7**_ is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TeamContact can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `TeamContact24-7-v1.4.jar` from the [tp2 Repo GitHub v1.4 release](https://github.com/AY2122S2-TIC4002-F18-5/tp2/releases/tag/v1.4).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your demo app.

4. Double-click the file to start the app or type `java -jar teamcontact24-7-v1.4.jar` at the terminal opened at working folder of the demo app.

5. A Login Screen will appear.

5. Enter your login data (demo Username usage = "Java", sample Password usage = "123456").

7. The GUI similar to that shown below will appear next. Note how the app contains some sample data and a in-use CLI edit command.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

8. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/09/08/2011 r/some comments` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the TeamContact 24/7 app.
   
   * **`email`**`micheal`: Send an email to a contact named `Micheal`
   
   * **`log`**`1 l/some brief communication note` : Logs a brief intercourse update on the 1st contact in the current display list.
     * _**NB:-** log is different from remark in the sense that log is for work-related notes only while remark is for all non work-related comments. A log is created via the log Command whereas remark is entered through the "r/" arg of add Command._
   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * **`export`** : Export all the contact details to text file.
      
   * **`undo`** : Restores the previous address book state from its history.
   
   * **`redo`** : Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.
   
   * **`sort`** : Sort all contacts.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

9. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `undo`, `redo`, `sort`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

Program data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TeamContact 24/7 app will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

### Securing the data file

The offline addressbook.json file is not encrypted by any means, it is visually exposed to public viewing,
so possibly running afoul of PDPA violation or subterfuge if fallen into the wrong hand.

We leave it to the user how he/she will want to personally configure or implement the encryption/decryption mechanism part where
the TeamContact 24/7 will save log, data and setting files in the current working folder, e.g. Windows user can use the
native Bitlocker or Explorer file/folder encryption features easily, or choose a third party tool like
[Easy File Locker](https://xoslab.com/efl.html) or [7-zip](https://7ziphelp.com/password-protect-on-7zip) to give
confidentiality to the folder, or a concerned file.


### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._
