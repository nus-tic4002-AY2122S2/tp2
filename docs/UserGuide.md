+ If NAME consists of two words, the sequence of words will not affect the search result. I.e. `find Duke John` will return both `John Duke`’s and `Duke John`’s contacts.

+ Contacts matching either one of the TAG returning a combined result set, the sequence of words will not affect the search result. I.e. `filter g501 g502` will return both `g501`’s and `g502`’s contacts.

Example:
```

```

### Rename tag from contacts: `rename`

+ For TAG to be renamed into multiple TAG, you may do by adding more parameter. I.e. `rename g501 t/graduated t/NUS` will remove all contact with existing 'g501' tag and add on new tag 'graduated' and 'NUS'.

Example:

Example:
```
bday 1
```



### Create relation among persons: `relate`
#### Relate multiple persons to someone

Format: `relate TO_SEQ_NO_OF_CONTACT <- FROM_SEQ_NO_OF_CONTACT1 FROM_SEQ_NO_OF_CONTACT2 ...`
+ The `relate` command has a 1 to n relationship 
+ TO_SEQ_NO_OF_CONTACT on the left hand side of `<-` is the target whom persons going to relate to
+ FROM_SEQ_NO_OF_CONTACTi on the right hand side of `<-` is the group to relate to the target one by one 
+ Relation is _mutual_. So A related to B, B also related to A automatically

Example:
```
relate 2 <- 1 4 5
```
**Recommended usage**:
+ you could first `filter` by tag like a class no. `g503`, then use `relate` to relate from all the students to a teacher in that class one at a time.
+ the SEQ_No_OF_CONTACT refers to the index no. of current displayed list, you could go back to the all contact list using `list`.
#### Show everyone related to a particular person
Format: `relate SEQ_NO_OF_CONTACT`
+ When there is no `<-` action symbol used, `relate` acts like a listing command that displays the person and whose every related persons

Example:
```
relate 2
```






So far, `relate` command does not support undo or deletion in v1.4, which could be considered for future updates. 


### Exit the program:
Format:      `exit`
+ The contact list will not be deleted after exiting.

Example:
```
exit
```
